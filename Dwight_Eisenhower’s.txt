I feel impelled to speak today in a language that, in a sense, is new. 
One which I, who have spent so much of my life in the military profession, would have preferred never to use: 
That new language is the language is the language of atomic warfareâ€¦
Against the dark background of the atomic bomb, 
the United States does not wish merely to present strength, 
but also the desire and the hope for peace. 
To the makers of these fateful decisions, the United States pledges before you, 
and therefore before the world, its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma. 
To devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man 
shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.
