This is preeminently the time to speak the truth,
the whole truth,frankly and boldly.
Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today.
This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.
So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itselfâ€¦ 
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. 
This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. 
It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, 
treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war.
