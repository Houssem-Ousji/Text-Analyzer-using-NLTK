For a century, we labored to settle and to subdue a continent. 
For half a century, we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty 
for all of our people. 
The challenge of the next half-century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich
and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization. 
Your imagination and your initiative and your indignation will determine whether we build a society 
where progress is the servant of our needs, or a society where old values and new visions are 
buried under unbridled growth. For in your time, we have the opportunity to move not only toward 
the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.
